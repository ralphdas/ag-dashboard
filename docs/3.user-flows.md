  QUESTIONS FOR SAM:
  - The sheduling needs to be refined. How does the user know how long the ad will be displayed? How does the user know how many people will see the ad?
  - The sheduling does not have a possibility for peak and off-peak times. How can we implement this?
  - The user does not see the impact of his or her choices on the price. How can we make this more transparent?
  - The demographic information we have currently is very minimal and maybe not very useful. Maybe we have to come up with a better way to collect this information.
  - Before the user goes to the checkout it would be nice to have a summary of the campaign. This way the user can see what he or she is paying for.
  - If a campaign is rejected this will happen after the payment is done. Maybe we can implement a way to take the money from the account after the campaign is approved.
  - How can we make it easier for clients to target a larger number of bins?
  - If I'm regularly creating campaigns for the same bins, can I save these bins in a list for easy access?
  - How can we make it easier for clients to target a specific demographic?
  - We need to be able to have PDF reports for the clients. How can we implement this?
  - How can we make it easier for clients to target a specific demographic?
  - It would be nice for venue owners to somehow see a DEMO version of the platform.
