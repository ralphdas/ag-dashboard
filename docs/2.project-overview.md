# Project Overview

### 1. Application Description

#### What is ADSBIN?
ADSBIN is a Digital Out of Home (DOOH) advertising platform that allows businesses to create, manage, and display digital advertisement campaigns on public screens. The first iteration of these screens will be integrated into a garbage bin(s). Venue owners can install these smart bins in high-traffic areas to generate additional revenue through a profit-sharing model integrated into the platform. Advertisers can create and schedule campaigns to be displayed on these screens, targeting specific demographics and locations.

#### Goals
The primary goal of ADSBIN is to provide a cost-effective and efficient advertising platform for businesses to reach their target audience. By leveraging the power of digital screens in public spaces, businesses can increase brand visibility and engagement with potential customers. The platform aims to streamline the process of creating and managing ad campaigns, making it accessible to businesses of all sizes.
