# API Design

In this document I will give an high-level overview of the API design. I will start by giving an overview of the API endpoints, and then move on to the data models.

## API Endpoints

The API will be RESTful and follow the REST principles. The API will be versioned, and the version should be included in the URL. The API will be documented using OpenAPI. All authentication will be done by the Clerk library and will fall out of scope for this document.
