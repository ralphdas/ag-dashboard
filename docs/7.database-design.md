# Database Design

In this document I will provide an overview of the database design for the application. I will start by giving an overview of the database schema, and then move on to the data flow. Since the application is still in the early stages of development, the database design is subject to change as the application evolves.

PS. We will use the Clerk API for authentication and authorization, so we will not cover that in this document.

## Data Flow

The data flow in the application will follow the following steps:

1. The user interacts with the frontend application.
2. The frontend application makes a request to the backend API.
3. The backend API processes the request and interacts with the database.
4. The database returns the requested data to the backend API.
5. The backend API sends the data back to the frontend application.
6. The frontend application updates the UI based on the data received.
7. The user interacts with the updated UI.
8. The cycle repeats as the user continues to interact with the application.
